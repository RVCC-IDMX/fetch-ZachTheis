# Fetch Demo

This program uses the fetch API to simulate a blog. It gets random text elements from [Json Placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts) and random images from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.it) to simulate 9 posts in a 3x3 grid. The images and text will be randomly generated each time.
